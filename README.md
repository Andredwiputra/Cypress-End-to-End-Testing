# Cypress-End-to-End-Testing
This is my first portofolio as a automation tester. I use https://magento.softwaretestingboard.com/ web to create a automation, this web specifically for testing automation scripts, Thank you for Magento, inc. I am very open if someone provides input for my automation script and feel free to use it. This script will always be updated.

How to Install this automation :
1. git clone https://github.com/Andredwiputra/Cypress-End-to-End-Testing.git
2. install "node js" (my version is 18.16.0 and npm version 8.12.2)
3. install cypress "npm install cypress --save-dev"
4. Open cypress with command "npx cypress open"
